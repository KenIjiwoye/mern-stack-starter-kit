# MERN Stack Starter Template
I find myself starting a lot of projects from scratch in this manner and it consumes a lot time to setup.

This template includes:

- Express generated package
- Redux wired up along with thunk and logger
- MongoDB with Mongoose

### Both frontend & backend servers can be run with one command

Concurrently is installed to help with running multiple scripts:

Using yarn
` yarn dev `
