# MERN Stack Starter Template
I find myself starting a lot of projects from scratch in this manner and it consumes a lot time to setup.
So, I created a starter template to help with getting up and running as quick as possible.

This template includes: 
- Create React App
- Express generated package
- Redux wired up along with thunk and logger
- MongoDB with Mongoose

### Both frontend & backend servers can be run with one command

Concurrently is installed to help with running multiple scripts:

Using yarn
` yarn dev `

### Getting Started

Clone the repo and do:
`yarn install`

Install dotenv and Create an .env and set your mongodb uri as "DB_HOST"

Should be good to go!
